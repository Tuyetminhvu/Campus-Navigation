# Campus Navigation

A Java application that helps students navigate a SLCC campus: search buildings, visualize paths, and compute shortest routes. The project includes an interactive UI and graph-based pathfinding (BFS for unweighted queries, Dijkstra for weighted routes).

##  Features

- **Search buildings & landmarks** by name or code.
- **Shortest-path routing** between any two points.
  - **BFS** (unweighted, fewest edges).
  - **Dijkstra** (weighted by distance / cost).
- **Interactive map overlays** (buildings, sidewalks, paths).
- **Live step‑by‑step directions** (origin → destination).
- **Configurable data sources** for buildings and edges.
- **Deterministic tests** for graph and algorithms.
